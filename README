# RSpec Testing of External Sites

This is a proof of concept project, for testing a site over HTTP with RSpec, Capybara, and PhantomJS.

It runs tests against the site that is in the "site" directory, without access to the process running the tested sites.

To run it, where `$` is your prompt, first run the test site

    $ cd site
    $ bundle install
    $ ruby app.rb

Then, in another terminal install the test app dependencies and run the tests with `rake`

    $ bundle install
    $ rake
